# Password Strength and Complexity Analyzer

This Python project evaluates the strength and complexity of passwords by analyzing various factors such as length, use of special characters, digits, and letter case. The program assigns a score to each password, providing users with a clear indication of its security level.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets minimum length requirements.
- **Character Variety**: Assesses the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Repetition Detection**: Flags passwords with repeated patterns or characters.
- **Common Password Check**: Compares passwords against a list of commonly used passwords.
- **Score Assignment**: Provides a numerical score based on the password's strength and complexity.

## How It Works

The program evaluates the password by running it through a series of checks, each contributing to the final score. The score helps users understand how secure their password is, and the tool offers suggestions for improvement if the password is deemed weak.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script with `python password.py`.
3. Enter a password when prompted, and receive an immediate evaluation and score.
